## Description of project

##### Welcome to **Talio**, your daily to-do application ! This app allows you to organize your tasks more easily, having a friendly, appealing interface. The project was built in a team of 5 for the OOP Project course in the 1st year Bachelor at TU Delft. Among the principal functionalities of Talio, you can:
+ **Create boards and lists**, so you can group your tasks
+ **Join other user-created boards**, so you can plan tasks with your friends
+ **Drag and drop cards**, so you can easily move tasks between lists
+ **Add advanced details to tasks**, so you can make them more customizable
+ **Change the color scheme of different components of the board**, so you can make your environment unique
+ **Add tags**, so you can categorize your tasks
+ **Interact with the interface through shortcuts**, so you do not have to use your mouse for every action
+ **Set passwords to boards**, so you can store private information in Talio
##### More than that, the app has fast synchronization within clients, so you can see real-time changes made by other users.
