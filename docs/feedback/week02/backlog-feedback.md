## Backlog Feedback

### Submission

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback:

### Backlog Structure

>Mark: **Fail**

Feedback:
- You should have Admin as a different stakeholder and you should have more terminology regarding lists, cards so on, otherwise stakeholders and terminology is good.
- The lack of epics and acceptance criteria subsections makes this a fail for now, but hopefully by the final deadline you should get the hang of it and write a very good backlog.
- The Markdown format and the user stories gathered so far makes this a good starting point.

### Epics

>Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: Is in MOSCOW format, so it does not have any mention of epics.
#### Tips:
- Parse from MOSCOW to Epics by final deadline.


### User Stories

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- The structure is good.
- Most of them have a good scope and don't overlap.
#### Tips:
- Some of them need to be written better so that everyone understands the topic. Try to recheck them.
- You should have acceptance criteria for the longer ones (see bellow).
- You can gather more user stories from the last QnA.
### Acceptance Criteria

>Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback:
- Every user story should be small and understandable or have at least a couple of concrete acceptance criteria.
- Try to look at the lectures on this and write sub points for every complex user story.
>Example:
> - As a user I want to be able to see my profile, so that I can edit my pictures.
>   - A button to access the profile exists.
>   - When clicking it, a profile page appears.
