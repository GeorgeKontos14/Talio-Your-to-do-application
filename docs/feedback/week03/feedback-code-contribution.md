### Isolation

### Code Reviews
>Grade: **Insufficient**

Feedback: **There was no code reviews.**
#### Keep in mind: 
- You should have comments on every MR that are clear and that are addressed and improved upon. 
- The more targeted they are the better. (i.e. if it is evident that they are directed at the lines of code, method or class in question)
- The more improvements I see from the comments, the better.
