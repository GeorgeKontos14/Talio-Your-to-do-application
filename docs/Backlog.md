# Talio User Stories
#### Stakeholders
*User*: Any person that is able to use the app.
*Admin*: A person that manages the server. 
#### Terminology
*Card*: An object on a board with a title that defines a task.
*Board*: A collection of cards of similar importance.
*Tags*: An attribute of cards that can be used to group them together.

#### MUST Requirements

*As an user, I want …*

- to create a single board where I could add cards, so I can start adding my tasks that need to be organized.
- to start the application without logging in, so I can see public boards as a user.
- to be able to add cards, so I can organize my tasks wisely.
- to create cards that consist solely of a title, so there would only be a short reminder of a task I have to do.
- to be able to access public boards created by me or other users, so I can see what tasks me and my friends have to do.
- to be able to change the order of cards within a board by dragging, so I can prioritize the important available tasks.
- to be able to make changes to a card that is visible to all users, so I can update my (or somebody else’s) tasks.

*As an admin, I want ...*

- to be able to delete boards, so I can remove them if they contain something offensive or if I want to clear space on the server.
- to be able to restart the server without losing any boards or cards, so updates are easy.

#### SHOULD Requirements

*As an user, I want ...*

- to create multiple boards, so I can have more specific boards. 
- to add a description and a task list to a card, so I can achieve a clearer demonstration of my tasks.
- to attach and change tags to each card, so I can specify  the importance/ category of it.
- to be able to drag cards between the boards, so I can change the collection they belong to.


*As an admin, I want…*
- to be able to change what boards a user can access.


#### COULD Requirements

*As an user, I want …*
- to customize the background color of a board or the color of a tag, so I can emphasize some cards and make the boards personalized.
- to use shortcuts to access specific features, eg. add tags, so I can save time and use the application with ease.
- to create password protected boards, so only users with the password can write on the board, while the rest of the users can only read it. 

*As an admin, I want…*
- to be able to change the password of a board, so I can have access to it/remove a user’s access to it, if it violates any rules.
