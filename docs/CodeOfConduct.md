# Code of Conduct  

### Team name: *Group 67*

#### Shared team values  
*Respect*: As team members, we are obliged to respect each other's different cultural backgrounds and values.  
*Commitment*: Every team member should be dedicated to the project.  
*Communication*: The team should be able and comfortable to communicate their strengths and weaknesses, and be able to provide meaningful feedback to each other.  

#### Assignment description
As team members, we need to communicate and work together towards delivering the final product on time. Every team member needs to finish the individual assignments or tasks he is handed by the team before the pre-arranged deadline. Additionally, everyone should help each other when needed. 

#### Target or ambition level
We aim for a final grade of 8. This number was decided because it is not an unrealistically high grade, but we also have ambitions beyond simply passing the course.

#### Products
Team should be able to deliver a functional application as described in the assignment description section. This, as well as all other related documents, will be submitted on our GitLab repository. While working, these documents can be shared on Google Docs, to work on them collectively. The standard of this work should be satisfactory to all group members before submitting, and so will be subject to our target grade and ambition level. The provided content should be well-documented and understandable by other team members.

#### Planning
To ensure each team member carries out their responsibilities, each Friday team will discuss progress of individual assignments and issues faced, in order to help each other. Every member will have a say in the final product, while Georgios Kontos is responsible for submitting the final assignment on Brightspace. 




#### Behavior 
Everyone is to be treated equally and with respect during discussions. Disagreements are to be debated, taking everyone’s ideas into consideration equally. People should show up to meetings on time, and be no more than 10 minutes late. If someone does not arrive in time, the meeting will start without them, and they should be briefed later about the discussed topics. All team members are obliged to respond to texts regarding future meetings and potential problems of their teammates as soon as possible, at most 24 hours after the text was sent. 

#### Communication
Team will use Google meets for online meetings, while meetings will also sometimes take place on campus. WhatsApp is used in order to agree on place, time and reason for a meeting and express issues faced during individual tasks.

#### Commitment
Code should return no Checkstyle errors. Moreover, variables, classes and methods should be named in a clear and understandable way and Javadocs should be able to explain the implemented functionality. Tests should cover most of the methods. Chairs should upload the agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting and minute takers’ notes should be clear and easy to understand and should be uploaded at most 24 hours after the meeting.

#### Division of tasks and roles
Every meeting will have a different chair and minute taker, so that every team member participates in both roles at least once. If there is a prominent issue that comes up in the middle of a week, we can notify each other to change the chair to someone who is most familiar with the issue. Minute takers are chosen arbitrarily.

#### Meetings
Meetings will take place every Tuesday afternoon, starting before the standard time of the meeting with the Teaching Assistant from the beginning of the Lab and ending with the official weekly meeting. Optional meetings may be scheduled upon agreement within the team in case an urgent matter needs to be discussed. The chair of the respective meeting will set the agenda, items and objectives. He will send the agenda to all the team members so they can prepare for the discussion.

#### Decision Making
Decisions are made by the majority vote, after everyone presents their arguments. In the case of a tie, the members with the strongest opinion for and against a decision should have a debate. Voting will take place again afterwards. As a last solution, we also ask the TA’s opinion on the subject. 

#### Dealing with conflicts
After discussion, we decide by the majority vote which of the conflicting options will be implemented.

#### Guidance
We expect feedback on the progress made towards the final product.

#### Consequences
If someone is consistently showing little to no progress, we will first talk to them to check what is going wrong. We will also try to help them to catch up with their tasks. If they still show no sign of improvement, we will consult our TA. If a team member is late in a meeting, they have to bring snacks to the next one. In case a team member does not respond to a message in the specified timeframe, they must do 10 push-ups during the pre-meetings on tuesday.
